## Introduction
SofaViscoElastic is a plugin for the Software Open Architecture Framework (SOFA) which implements the fundamental linear viscoelastic constitutive laws applied to tetrahedral meshes.
Viscoelasticity is a property of elastomeric materials that influences their mechanical behavior under dynamic conditions. In fact, viscoelastic constitutive equations are dependent on the stress/strain rate. At low stress/strain rates, a viscoelastic material behaves like a viscous liquid-like material, while at high stress/strain rates, the same material behaves like a Hookean solid. In fact, the simplest viscoelastic models are:

These two models represent the basic unit that constitutes the viscoelastic materials. They are composed of an elastic part described by the spring symbol and a viscous one represented by the dashpot.
Elastomers and rubbers are polymeric materials present in nature but are also used in several industrial applications. Many research fields are involved in developing new elastomeric materials and rubbers, such as soft robotics and surgical applications. For this reason, this plugin is indicated for users who want a realistic mechanical simulation of these materials afflicted by the viscoelastic effect.
