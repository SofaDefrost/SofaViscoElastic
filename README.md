## Introduction
SofaViscoElastic is a plugin for the Software Open Architecture Framework (SOFA) which implements the fundamental linear viscoelastic models applied to tethrahedral meshes.
Viscoelaticity is a property of elastomeric materials which influence their mechanical behavior under dynamic conditions. In fact, viscoelastic materials present a dependency on the stress/strain rate in their constitutive equations.
Elastomers and rubbers are polymeric materials presnet in nature but also used in several industrial applications and many research field are involved in developed of new elastomeric materials and rubbers. Futhermoe they are also used in soft robotics and surgical applications. For this reason this plugin is indicated to have a realistic mechanical simulations of these material afflicted by viscoelastic effect.
