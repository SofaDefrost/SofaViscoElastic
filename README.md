## Introduction
SofaViscoElastic is a plugin for the Software Open Architecture Framework (SOFA) which implements the fundamental linear viscoelastic constitutive laws applied to tetrahedral meshes.
Viscoelasticity is a property of elastomeric materials that influences their mechanical behavior under dynamic conditions. In fact, viscoelastic constitutive equations are dependent on the stress/strain rate, which means the temporal derivative of the stress/strain tensors: 

Elastomers and rubbers are polymeric materials present in nature but also used in several industrial applications and many research fields are involved in the development of new elastomeric materials and rubbers, such as soft robotics and surgical applications. For this reason, this plugin is indicated for users who want to have a realistic mechanical simulation of these materials afflicted by the viscoelastic effect.
